- Use different fill colors for when the wave is above / below the zero line
- Incrementally load plots to decrease load time
- Resample data at lower rate when creating SAC P2 to decrease load time
- read colors of pick lines from ttconfig
- read colors of selected / deselected seismograms from ttconfig
- Use GMT for plotting stations
- Decrease padding between plots
- Add lines between plots
- Reorder buttons to a more natural order
- Update Setup.py, to not conflict with the original AIMBAT

Completed
